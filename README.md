# cozmo
This is my first creation in python, please feel free  to try it, I sadly offer no gauruntee of how well it will work, I intend to extend it to also display the battery voltages on cozmo's screen.
Intermediate versions have not been loaded to github, the latest vesion V5 has additioan featurs
The cube being reported now lights up, and goes off again after reporting is complete
The audio report has been edited to join the Voltage and percentage into one sentance
